A powerful trading bot that automates the process of sniping new token launches on Raydium. This bot evaluates potential tokens based on high-filter criteria and ensures early entry and strategic exits in the market. 📈💎

## Key Features 🌟

- **Token Sniping**: Automatically buys tokens at launch based on a set of criteria. 🎯
- **Advanced Filters**: Only trades tokens that meet strict conditions, including:
  - Minimum and maximum pool size 🏊‍♂️
  - Token liquidity pool (LP) is burned 🔥
  - Token mint is renounced 🚫

- **Auto-Sell**: Automatically sells tokens based on predefined conditions 🔄
- **Fast Execution**: The bot places orders faster than most buyers, giving you a competitive edge ⚡

## How It Works 🔧

The bot works by connecting to the Solana blockchain, subscribing to transaction logs on Raydium, and monitoring liquidity pool changes. It uses advanced filtering to ensure only viable tokens are traded, preventing losses from unfavorable pools or token contracts.

### Trade Flow 🔄

1. **Filter Criteria**: The bot checks the token's pool size, liquidity status, mint status, and token holders' information. 📏
2. **Buy**: If the token passes the criteria, the bot places an initial buy order. 🛒
3. **Monitor**: The bot tracks the pool and token status to ensure the investment remains profitable. 📈
4. **Sell**: The bot sells the token once predefined conditions are met (e.g., price increase or stop loss). 💸
5. **Dynamic Conditions**: You can set custom buy amounts, stop loss, and sell percentages. 🛠️
